================

## Notes

This repository contains data and code from:

Ramsey, D.S.L., Watters, F., Forsyth, D.M., Wood, M., Todd, C.R.,
Molsher, R., and Cassey, P. (2020). “Long-term fertility control reduces
overabundant koala populations and mitigates their impacts on food
trees” *Biological Conservation*

## Getting started

**File descriptions**:

*R/BBNP\_koala\_ipm.R* – R and JAGS code to fit the koala Integrated
Population Model (IPM) to data from Budj Bim National Park, Victoria.
Uses data saved in *Data/BBNP\_ipm\_data.Rdata*

*R/BBNP\_tree\_condition.R* – R and JAGS code to fit the multistate tree
condition model to data from Budj Bim National Park. Uses data saved in
*Data/BBNP\_tree\_data.Rdata*

## Prerequisites

The simulation script require packages *tidyverse*, *jagsUI*,
*mcmcOutput*, *grid* and *gridExtra* .
